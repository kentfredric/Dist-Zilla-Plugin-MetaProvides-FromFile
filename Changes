          Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL
            ( Yeilding more accurate t/ depends )
          Removed =inc::Dist style loopback in favour
            of the more reliable and more generic
            =inc::lib

          Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12 06:17:57 UTC
          Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes
           problems for some. Apparently deping on something that 
           may or may not be in core which may or may not be in core
           later is a bad thing. 
          Added CompileTests
          Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.
